# README: Advanced H1B LCA Data Analysis Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the H1B Labor Condition Application (LCA) disclosure data (2020-2024), leveraging large-scale data processing techniques, machine learning models, and statistical analysis to uncover employment trends, wage disparities, and approval dynamics in the U.S. job market.

Faced with a massive dataset of over 3.5 million records , we employed a structured and scalable approach to efficiently process and analyze the data. Our workflow combines Docker-based infrastructure ,  Azure Data Studio for initial exploration , and  Jupyter Notebooks for iterative analysis and modeling , demonstrating our expertise in handling large-scale real-world data.

## 3. Scalable Data Processing & Cleaning

### 3.1 Infrastructure & Tooling 

Given the sheer size of the dataset, we took a  scalable approach :

- Docker Containers : Built an isolated environment to process and analyze large datasets efficiently, reducing dependency conflicts and improving scalability.
-  Azure Data Studio : Used for  initial SQL-based exploration before filtering down relevant subsets, reducing  query execution time by 60% compared to local SQL execution.
-  Local Jupyter Notebooks : After preprocessing, we transitioned to Jupyter for  data cleaning, EDA, and model training , improving interactivity and allowing for rapid iteration in  real-time analysis .

###  3.2 Data Cleaning & Transformation 

-  Handling Duplicate Case Numbers : Discovered  over 1.3 million duplicate case numbers , mainly due to multiple applications for the same job at a company.
-  Standardizing Wage Data : Converted  hourly, monthly, and yearly salaries into a unified annual pay scale, ensuring comparability across different job roles.
-  Outlier Detection : Removed erroneous wage values (e.g., \$1/year or \$1,000,000/hour) using statistical anomaly detection, improving model reliability.
-  Feature Engineering : Created  new features such as `job stability`, `employer consistency`, and `regional salary competitiveness`, increasing model predictive power by  15% .

## 4. Advanced Data Analysis & Modeling

###  4.1 Baseline Model: Logistic Regression 

Our initial approach was to develop a  logistic regression model to predict H1B approval based on key features like `job title`, `employer`, `salary`, and `work location`. However, we quickly discovered an  extreme class imbalance :

-  99% of cases were approved , making accuracy a misleading metric.
-  Precision and recall were poor , as the model simply predicted "approved" for nearly all cases.

###  4.2 Handling Class Imbalance 

To address this, we implemented:

-  Undersampling & Oversampling : Adjusted the dataset distribution using  SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) , increasing recall for minority cases by  30% .
-  Ensemble Methods : Tried  Random Forest and XGBoost , significantly improving classification performance by  40% in F1-score .
-  Feature Selection : Conducted  correlation analysis to remove redundant variables, focusing on  meaningful predictors like employer reputation, industry, and salary competitiveness.

###  4.3 Final Model & Performance 

After optimization, we deployed an  XGBoost classifier , achieving:

-  Balanced Precision-Recall through advanced resampling techniques
-  Feature Importance Insights :
  - High salaries  increase approval probability.
  - Certain industries  face stricter approval rates .
  - Large tech firms  dominate approvals , but mid-sized firms show more variance.

## 5. Key Findings & Insights

###  5.1 Employer & Industry Trends 

-  Tech giants (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) lead in H1B sponsorship, with over  20% of total filings .
-  Startups & SMEs show higher variance in approval rates, likely due to inconsistent documentation.

###  5.2 Wage Pattern

- Despite high wage offers,  some industries face disproportionately high rejection rates , suggesting policy-driven scrutiny.
- Wage transparency laws might impact future LCA filings, requiring firms to adjust their application strategies.
